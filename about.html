    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Nowadays, AI (Artificial Intelligence) has a wide range of applications in the field of software engineering (SE). AI-based solutions are widely employed for automated code generation, bug detection and fixing, automated testing, and many other challenging tasks.  While these solutions have shown impressive results in the SE field, their application poses reliability and security concerns. 
    Addressing the reliability and security aspects of AI-based solutions for SE requires a holistic approach. It involves careful consideration of data quality, model performance, monitoring, privacy measures, security practices, and ongoing maintenance to ensure robust and secure AI systems.</p>
    
    <p>The objectives of this workshop are to bring together researchers and industrial practitioners both from both AI and SE communities to collaborate, share experiences, provide directions for future research, and encourage the use of reliable and secure AI solutions for addressing software engineering-specific challenges. We encourage submissions targeting interdisciplinary research, in particular those listed in the topics of interest. Papers targeting the reliability and security of AI code assistants are especially welcome.</p>

    <p>Attendees will have the opportunity to participate in keynote speeches, panel discussions, paper presentations led by renowned speakers and researchers in the industry. </p>
    <p>Join us at the Academic Conference to explore the latest developments in AI for software engineering and network with peers and experts in the field.</p>

    <h2>Topics of interest</h2>
    This call for papers addresses all researchers and practitioners interested in all the reliability and security aspects of AI in the SE field. Topics addressed in the workshop include but are not limited to:
